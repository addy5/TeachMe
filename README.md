#**Project 2 - TeachMe**

TeachMe is a website where users can log in to their account and make posts offering lessons in a skill they are experts in. Their listings will show their coverage area (city), description,  rate (cost) or lessons from other users that they would be willing to accept as payment. Other users can view their listing and respond is interested.

Core Functions / MVP:
 1. create, login, and edit a user account.
 2. create, edit, delete list of offerings by users.
 3. some type of response system to coordinate communication between users.
 4. visually appealing and easy to use.

Optional Functions :
* Calendar to show availability on listing page
* Google map to show location on listing
* User dashboard to organize, archive, delete requests

As a user I want to be able to easily navigate the websites feature without guessing.

As a teacher, I want to be able to post my listing within 5 minutes of accessing the website.
